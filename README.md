[FIXED]IF COMPILATION FAILED, PLEASE TRY AGAIN. IT CAN TAKE MAYBE 10 TRIES TO GET COMPILED DEPENDING ON YOUR LUCK. THIS IS BECAUSE THAT THE TURTLE_VIS PKG DEPENDS ON A .SO LIBRARY FILE WHICH MUST BE GENERATED FIRST. HOWEVER, THE COMPILE ORDER IS RANDOM... WE ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION TO THIS. <br>
<br>
[FIXED]DUE TO UNFIXED DEPENDENCY PROBLEMS, THE MAIN_STATE_MACHINE PACKAGE MUST BE CATKIN_MADE FIRST. WAIT TO BE FIXED.<br>

The launcher.launch file in main_state_machine package launches all nodes.
